1- If you have a user requirement to create a new page what are the steps you take to
create the solution focusing on (UI,UX, FE)

 Answer: I always focus on the user giving me an explanation with the maximum
 possible detail about what they expect from the screens, accompanying the process with wireframe design and mockups. 
 When this is well defined, I move on to the component design stage, always keeping the concept
 of "view over components" in hierarchy, since I personally do not like to treat each piece of code as a component. 
 This stage is also when I carry out analysis on technologies that fit well with what I want to do (state management, CSS frameworks, etc.).
To finally move on to the implementation and subsequent testing stage.

2.Do you have experience using state management libraries? Can you explain how you used it?

 Anser: Yes, I have used the recoil library for a while, for state management in react. 
 It seems to me to be a perfect tool for grouping logic outside the component in an external layer, 
 and it also allows data filtering through selectors, which in turn can be treated as independent states
 to be shared between components. Plus, its learning curve is really simple. I always use it to fetch data from backend
 and store it as a base state, which in future, can be mutated by selectors.

3. What are some of the code best practices you use in your experience?

 Answer: 
 - Separation of concerns.
 - Performance of componentes (process of rendering)
 - Keep components simples and with single responsability.
 - Separate UI components from Logic components.
 - No excesive documentation.
